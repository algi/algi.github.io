Hi, I'm a fractional CTO working with pre-seed, seed-level and A series startups.

-- **working with startup mindset** - prefer done over perfect, lean approach to team structure and processes makes me a good fit in startup culture

Does your business need a web or mobile application? I provide full package necessary to make that happen, including:
- technology & architecture assessment
- hiring & building team
- provide security & compliance audit

## My tech team is slow!
Does your engineering team moves slowly and you don't know why? Are they often confused, deliver too late and the app is constantly having problems? I will look at the following areas:
- focused and efficient communication between leadership and teams themselves
- efficient project management for small teams
- flexible and actionable technical strategy
- engineering processess and best practices
