Hi, I'm a fractional CTO working with pre-seed, seed-level and A series startups.

## My tech team is slow!
Does your engineering team moves slowly and you don't know why? Are they often confused, deliver too late and the app is constantly having problems? I will look at the following areas:
- focused and efficient communication between leadership and teams themselves
- efficient project management for small teams
- flexible and actionable technical strategy
- engineering processess and best practices
