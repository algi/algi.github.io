# Headline (done)
Hi, I'm a fractional CTO helping seed-level and A series startups to grow meaningfully.

# What you can expect from me (in progress)
- Empowered & Connected People
    - empowered = full ownership & responsibility, enough context, building trust
    - connected = no silos and no politics, free access to information
    - well organised = good processes & tools that serve people
    - safe, honest & open culture for whole company = best results, enjoyable workplace

- Pragmatic approach to Technology & Innovation
    - Technology must grow with the business without being a burden (too complex, expensive and not easily replacable)
    - Innovation must be based on thoughtful experimentation that focuses on measurable results
    - "Fake it until you make it" -> use premade solutions when possible, in-house solutions must bring tangible value (save money)

- Impactful and enjoyable Business
    - working with entrepreneurs -> love building / scaling the business
    - business with positive (social/environment) impact
    - business that is close to my heart
    - business that is fun to do

- describe package: handled software development, necessary processes, due diligence, ...

# What you can expect from working with me as a fractional CTO?
1. Leadership & Expertise
    - I use my Leadership & Expertise to build empowered teams, efficient process & right culture to solve the problems, instead of doing things manually by myself and thus not solving the actual root of the problem.

2. Mindful hands-on approach
    - I don't shy away from focused hands-on approach, when the problem requires my expertise or "shit hits the fan".

3. Time efficient approach
    - This is especially true for fractional CTO whose time is limited. That's why I focus on coaching & mentoring and setting up the right processes and communication channels.
    - I do the hard work of being efficient with your time, which means that whatever I can get done myself, I do.
