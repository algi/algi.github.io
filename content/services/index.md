# What you can expect from working with me as a fractional CTO?
## Leadership & Expertise
I use my Leadership & Expertise to build empowered teams, efficient process & right culture to solve the problems, instead of doing things manually by myself and thus not solving the actual root of the problem.

## Mindful hands-on approach
I don't shy away from focused hands-on approach, when the problem requires my expertise or "shit hits the fan".

## Time efficient approach
This is especially true for fractional CTO whose time is limited. That's why I focus on coaching & mentoring and setting up the right processes and communication channels.
I do the hard work of being efficient with your time, which means that whatever I can get done myself, I do.
